# Benchtools

a python library designed to help people design and run LLM benchmarks



## Orientation to the Repo

- the `benchtools` folder is the code for the library
- `demobench` is a very minimal example benchmark that will function somewhere in between tests and docs.  eventually probably needs to be actually moved into one of those cases, but for now a top level so it can do both during development
- `docs` will hold documentation files that can render to a website with sphinx
- `project.toml` should provide info to make `pip install .` work
