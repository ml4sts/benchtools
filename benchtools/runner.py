        -----------
        runner_type: str default 'ollama'
            The used engine for running an LLM. Default is ollama that will need to be installed and running on your machine
        model: str default 'gemma3'
            The name of the LLM to use for running the tasks. Default is 'gemma3'. P.S. Will need to have the model downloaded locally if using ollama
        api_url: str
            The URL of the API to use for accessing an LLM. If None, the default API will be http://localhost:11434 as this is used by ollama by default
